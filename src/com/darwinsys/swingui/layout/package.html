A few interesting LayoutManager implementations.
Most are more illustrative than "product quality";
I tend to use these in showing how layout management works.
They are missing the nuance and attention to detail required
of "ready for prime time" layout managers, with the possible
exception of RelativeLayout.
<p>
If you spend the time to productize any of these, please send
your code changes back to me -- thanks.
