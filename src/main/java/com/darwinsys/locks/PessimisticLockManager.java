/** 
 * PessimisticLockManager keeps track of Locks and
 * their id's, which would normally be the (possibly compound)
 * primary key of the row being locked).
 * There's no expiry notification (indeed, the thread that
 * got the lock might not be active when expiry happens),
 * so it's crucial that you check isReleased()
 * before proceding with the operation that was locked.
 * Example:
 * PessimisticLockManager&lt;Integer&lt; mgr =
 * new PessimisticLockManagerImpl&lt;Integer&lt;();
 * Lock l = mgr.tryLock(123);
 * ...
 * if (l.isReleased()) {
 *   message("Sorry, you took too long");
 *   return;
 *   }
 * ... OK, commit the order... 
 * l.release();
 * @param T The pkey of the datatype being locked
 * @author Ian Darwin, based on a design from Stephen Neal
