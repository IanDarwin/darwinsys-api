<h1>Java Cookbook API Documentation... </h1>
<p><a href="api/index.html">This section</a> documents the API used throughout 
the Java Cookbook, in the various com.darwinsys packages that
are meant for direct re-use.
</p>
<p><b>N.B.:</b>This documentation refers to the versions of these files
described in the latest edition of the Java Cookbook.
If you are using these files with an older edition, there will be a lot
of problems.
In particular from the first edition,
 because the old com.darwinsys.util package has been split
into half a dozen sub-packages, and many classes renamed.
