<h1>Java Cookbook API Documentation... </h1>
<p><a href="api/index.html">This section</a> documents the API used throughout 
the Java Cookbook, in the various com.darwinsys packages that
are meant for direct re-use.
</p>
<p><b>N.B.:</b>This documentation refers to the versions of these files
described in the Second Edition of the Java Cookbook,
which was released mid-2004.
If you are using these files with the first edition, there will be a lot
of problems, because the old com.darwinsys.util package has been split
into half a dozen sub-packages, and many classes renamed.
