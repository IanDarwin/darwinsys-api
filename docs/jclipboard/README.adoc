= JClipboard

NB This program was formerly its own repo, which was a mistake.

Maintains a list of clipboard shortcuts, each a name-value pair.

Tries to iconify itself into the system taskbar, where supported.

Properties are stored in a Java properties file in your home directory,
jclipboard.properties, which can safely be edited while the program
is not running.
