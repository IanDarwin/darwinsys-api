There's obviously lots still to do:

Medium items:
- GUI version should have gui for creating/editing .db.properties.
= UI to run external script file

Several items from J.Fuerth at SQLPower, who are using it in their Architect:

Command history is definitely a useful feature that we should have
soon, but I think the following are even more important:

Showing the results of a select statement in a JTable whose columns
are automatically sized to be just large enough to contain the largest
data in a column.  This should also be the default output format. The
columns should be sortable by clicking on the headers; I think the
canonical code from the 'net that provides this feature on JTable is
already in the Architect codebase somewhere.
[Partly implemented, see the Table formatter in the source folder.]
